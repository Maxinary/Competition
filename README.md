A competition between friends for making the most efficient code for different projects

##Rules
<ol>
<li>Nobody can have direct experience with the subject before it starts</li>
<li>Everyone must try not to learn any information pertinent to the subject matter. We use the honor system because we are friends
<li>After a predetermined amount of time, or when all of us are satisfied with our work(whichever comes first) we will write a program to find the efficiency of each of our programs, and the most efficient code wins</i>
<ul>
<li>Note: efficiency does not necessarily mean fewest CPU cycles, but it is some agreed upon predetermined goal</li>
</ul>
